### Description
It is necessary to get the top of the page when navigating from one page to another of the current website.
The image below shows an example: the user is on page PRODUCTS and wants to go to page ABOUT US

<img src="img/1.png" width="100%">

It is likely that the new page will be in the same position as the previous one (at the bottom if the previous one was at the bottom)

<img src="img/2.png" width="100%">

<img src="img/3.png" width="100%">
