### Description
Forms are usually assigned for data entry. Having received some information from the user, we want to use it. To do this, you need to add actions that will handle events made by the user or the browser.

**General way to add events to an element:**
> ````Javascript 
> <element onEvent={event_handler}>
> ````
where 
  `element` - React element, <br />
  `onEvent` - an attribute that describes the action took place,
  `event_handler` - a function that handles user or browser action

**You have a contact form! 🎉**
